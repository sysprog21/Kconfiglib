Overview
========

A terminal-based menuconfig implementation using rawterm (pure-Python terminal
I/O). The interface should feel familiar to people used to mconf
('make menuconfig').

Supports the same keys as mconf, and also supports a set of keybindings
inspired by Vi:

  J/K      : Down/Up
  L        : Enter menu/Toggle item
  H        : Leave menu
  Ctrl-D/U : Page Down/Page Up
  G/End    : Jump to end of list
  g/Home   : Jump to beginning of list

The bottom of the dialog shows five buttons: Select, Exit, Help, Save, Load.
[Tab]/[Left]/[Right] cycle between buttons. [Enter] activates the focused
button. [Space] toggles values if possible, and enters menus otherwise.

The mconf feature where pressing a key jumps to a menu entry with that
character in it in the current menu isn't supported. A jump-to feature for
jumping directly to any symbol (including invisible symbols), choice, menu or
comment (as in a Kconfig 'comment "Foo"') is available instead.

A few different modes are available:

  F: Toggle show-help mode, which shows the help text of the currently selected
  item in the window at the bottom of the menu display. This is handy when
  browsing through options.

  C: Toggle show-name mode, which shows the symbol name before each symbol menu
  entry

  A: Toggle show-all mode, which shows all items, including currently invisible
  items and items that lack a prompt. Invisible items are drawn in a different
  style to make them stand out.


Running
=======

menuconfig.py can be run either as a standalone executable or by calling the
menuconfig() function with an existing Kconfig instance. The second option is a
bit inflexible in that it will still load and save .config, etc.

When run in standalone mode, the top-level Kconfig file to load can be passed
as a command-line argument. With no argument, it defaults to "Kconfig".

The KCONFIG_CONFIG environment variable specifies the .config file to load (if
it exists) and save. If KCONFIG_CONFIG is unset, ".config" is used.

When overwriting a configuration file, the old version is saved to
<filename>.old (e.g. .config.old).

$srctree is supported through Kconfiglib.


Color schemes
=============

The default color scheme matches the Linux kernel's menuconfig (mconf/lxdialog).
It is possible to customize the color scheme by setting the MENUCONFIG_STYLE
environment variable.

This is the current list of built-in styles:
    - linux         style matching the Linux kernel's menuconfig (mconf/lxdialog) [default]
    - monochrome    colorless theme (uses only bold and standout) attributes,
                    this style is used if the terminal doesn't support colors

It is possible to customize the current style by changing colors of UI
elements on the screen. This is the list of elements that can be stylized:

    - screen        Full-screen background behind the dialog
    - path          Top row in the main display, with the menu path
    - separator     Separator lines between windows. Also used for the top line
                    in the symbol information display.
    - list          List of items, e.g. the main display
    - selection     Style for the selected item
    - inv-list      Like list, but for invisible items. Used in show-all mode.
    - inv-selection Like selection, but for invisible items. Used in show-all
                    mode.
    - help          Help text windows at the bottom of various fullscreen
                    dialogs
    - show-help     Window showing the help text in show-help mode
    - frame         Frame around pop-up dialog boxes
    - body          Body of the main dialog
    - edit          Edit box in pop-up dialogs
    - jump-edit     Edit box in jump-to dialog
    - text          Symbol information text
    - title         Dialog title text
    - border        Border of the main dialog box
    - menubox       Inner menu box border (left/top edges)
    - menubox-border Inner menu box border (right/bottom edges and fill)

The color definition is a comma separated list of attributes:

    - fg:COLOR      Set the foreground/background colors. COLOR can be one of
      * or *        the basic 16 colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue,
    - bg:COLOR      magenta, cyan, white and brighter versions, for example,
                    brightred). On terminals that support more than 8 colors,
                    you can also directly put in a color number, e.g. fg:123
                    (hexadecimal and octal constants are accepted as well).
                    Colors outside the range -1..255 are ignored (with a
                    warning). The COLOR can be also specified using a RGB
                    value in the HTML notation, for example #RRGGBB. The
                    color is rendered using the closest available
                    representation for the terminal.

                    If the background or foreground color of an element is not
                    specified, it defaults to the terminal default color.

                    Note: On some terminals a bright version of the color
                    implies bold.
    - bold          Use bold text
    - underline     Use underline text
    - standout      Standout text attribute (reverse color)

More often than not, some UI elements share the same color definition. In such
cases the right value may specify an UI element from which the color definition
will be copied. For example, "separator=help" will apply the current color
definition for "help" to "separator".

A keyword without the '=' is assumed to be a style template. The template name
is looked up in the built-in styles list and the style definition is expanded
in-place. With this, built-in styles can be used as basis for new styles.

For example, take the aquatic theme and give it a red selection bar:

MENUCONFIG_STYLE="aquatic selection=fg:white,bg:red"

If there's an error in the style definition or if a missing style is assigned
to, the assignment will be ignored, along with a warning being printed on
stderr.

The 'linux' theme is always implicitly parsed first, so the following two
settings have the same effect:

    MENUCONFIG_STYLE="selection=fg:white,bg:red"
    MENUCONFIG_STYLE="linux selection=fg:white,bg:red"

If the terminal doesn't support colors, the 'monochrome' theme is used, and
MENUCONFIG_STYLE is ignored.


Other features
==============

  - Seamless terminal resizing

  - No curses dependency -- uses rawterm, a pure-Python terminal I/O module.
    Works on Unix and Windows 10+ without any pip install.

  - Unicode text entry

  - Improved information screen compared to mconf:

      * Expressions are split up by their top-level &&/|| operands to improve
        readability

      * Undefined symbols in expressions are pointed out

      * Menus and comments have information displays

      * Kconfig definitions are printed

      * The include path is shown, listing the locations of the 'source'
        statements that included the Kconfig file of the symbol (or other
        item)
